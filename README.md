define( 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY', 'your-api-key-here' );

// For OpenAI
define( 'OPENAI_API_KEY', 'your-api-key-here' );

// For Google Gemini
define( 'GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY', 'your-api-key-here' );
```

### Default Settings

The plugin sets these defaults on activation:

- **Default Model**: Claude Sonnet 4
